# Code Quiz

Code Quiz application was created using JavaScript programming language. It is a homework project, created while I'm attending the Web Development Course at UofT School of Continuing Studies.

## Usage

User will notice following files: 'index.html', 'scores.html', 'styles.css', 'scores.js' and 'script.js'. Also, there's a README file.
As the user opens the index.html file in his default browser he is led to a webpage where he can start the quiz. After the user clicks on the
'Start Quiz' button he is led to five questions he needs to answer as quickly as possible. Every correct answer takes the user towards the next question
with an intact highscore. Every incorrect answer subtracts time from the counter (points). User with the highest score wins. Ultimately, the user can clear the scores
by clicking the 'Clear Highscores' button and start a new game by clicking the 'Go Back' button.
